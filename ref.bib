  abstract        = {Verifying real-world programs often requires inferring loop
                  invariants with nonlinear constraints. This is especially true
                  in programs that perform many numerical operations, such as
                  control systems for avionics or industrial plants. Recently,
                  data-driven methods for loop invariant inference have shown
                  promise, especially on linear invariants. However, applying
                  data-driven inference to nonlinear loop invariants is
                  challenging due to the large numbers of and magnitudes of
                  high-order terms, the potential for overfitting on a small
                  number of samples, and the large space of possible inequality
                  bounds. In this paper, we introduce a new neural architecture
                  for general SMT learning, the Gated Continuous Logic Network
                  (G-CLN), and apply it to nonlinear loop invariant learning.
                  G-CLNs extend the Continuous Logic Network (CLN) architecture
                  with gating units and dropout, which allow the model to
                  robustly learn general invariants over large numbers of terms.
                  To address overfitting that arises from finite program
                  sampling, we introduce fractional sampling---a sound
                  relaxation of loop semantics to continuous functions that
                  facilitates unbounded sampling on real domain. We additionally
                  design a new CLN activation function, the Piecewise Biased
                  Quadratic Unit (PBQU), for naturally learning tight inequality
                  bounds. We incorporate these methods into a nonlinear loop
                  invariant inference system that can learn general nonlinear
                  loop invariants. We evaluate our system on a benchmark of
                  nonlinear loop invariants and show it solves 26 out of 27
                  problems, 3 more than prior work, with an average runtime of
                  53.3 seconds. We further demonstrate the generic learning
                  ability of G-CLNs by solving all 124 problems in the linear
                  Code2Inv benchmark. We also perform a quantitative stability
                  evaluation and show G-CLNs have a convergence rate of $97.5\%$
                  on quadratic problems, a $39.2\%$ improvement over CLN
                  models.},
